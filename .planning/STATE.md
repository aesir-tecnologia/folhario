# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** A beginner in Brazil goes from "I have no idea what this plant is" to "identified, cataloged, with care guidance" in under 2 minutes from email verification — honestly, without jargon, without fake confidence scores, and without hiding AI provenance.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & CI/CD

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Next 16 App Router + Serwist (not next-pwa), GitHub Actions as sole deploy pipeline (Vercel git integration OFF)
- Phase 1: Drizzle + `postgres-js` + `{ prepare: false }` mandatory for Supavisor txn pooler (stack lock-in from CLAUDE.md)
- Phase 1: Inngest for all async (no raw cron, no BullMQ) — enables `step.sleepUntil` for Phase 11's 7-day LGPD grace

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Launch-blocker dependencies tracked in ROADMAP.md "Launch-Blocker Dependencies" section — not dev tasks, but Phase 12 gates production deploy on all five:
1. BRL monthly pricing (blocks Phase 10 live mode)
2. NFS-e issuance strategy (Phase 10 ships without; post-launch gap for Brazilian fiscal compliance)
3. DPO appointment (blocks Phase 4 consent flow going live)
4. Privacy policy + ToS authoring (blocks Phase 4 consent flow going live)
5. ≥200 curated care guides (Phase 7 dev ships empty; launch needs the corpus)
